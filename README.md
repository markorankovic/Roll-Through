# Rollswhere-Old-

This was a physics puzzle game I was working on for iOS and macOS, the game consists of 11 levels.

The goal on this game is to get the ball into the green pipe, you can only shoot the ball in one direction, but with help of moveable objects, you can bounce the ball in the intended direction.

To navigate through the levels, swipe through the main menu with two fingers (trackpad or screen if on iOS). To get to main menu from the game, tap the screen or press escape to get an option to return to main menu.

#Instructions for playing
During the game, wait for the ball to be in resting position. Drag the ball to reveal its power, which is a glowing red line that goes around the ball and when ready to shoot release the finger. For moving objects, find blocks that filled in blue and drag them. To rotate, drag the block and move in a circle with two fingers.
